# ELS-Windows-Launcher

ELS-Windows-Launcher contains the C++ files used to build the Windows Launcher for ELS.

It uses MinGW for the compiler to create a statically-linked executable.

If you just want the executable, for now go to: [https://github.com/Corionis/ELS/tree/Version-4.0.0/artifacts/stage/windows](https://github.com/Corionis/ELS/tree/Version-4.0.0/artifacts/stage/windows).
